/*****
** kmeans.c
** - a simple k-means clustering routine
** - returns the cluster labels of the data points in an array
** - here's an example
**   extern int *k_means(double**, int, int, int, double, double**);
**   ...
**   int *c = k_means(data_points, num_points, dim, 20, 1e-4, 0);
**   for (i = 0; i < num_points; i++) {
**      printf("data point %d is in cluster %d\n", i, c[i]);
**   }
**   ...
**   free(c);
** Parameters
** - array of data points (double **data)
** - number of data points (int n)
** - dimension (int m)
** - desired number of clusters (int k)
** - error tolerance (double t)
**   - used as the stopping criterion, i.e. when the sum of
**     squared euclidean distance (standard error for k-means)
**     of an iteration is within the tolerable range from that
**     of the previous iteration, the clusters are considered
**     "stable", and the function returns
**   - a suggested value would be 0.0001
** - output address for the final centroids (double **centroids)
**   - user must make sure the memory is properly allocated, or
**     pass the null pointer if not interested in the centroids
